# Password-Generator
Java console application designed as a proof of concept for another project. **(Created and tested on windows 10 )**

Users can generate passwords from a list of available options.

  <summary>Available options</summary>
  
  #### Options
  * Digits
  * All characters
  * Small characters
  * Capital characters
  * Symbols
  * All of the above
  
</details>

Updates might be done in the future. The program does not support two or more options at this time

### How to use

#### Option 1:
There is a **_.bat_** file called "start_application.bat" at **_out/artifacts/Password_Generator_jar_**.  
It launches the .jar file containing the program. You may rename it however you want. In case you delete the file you can easily recreate it
